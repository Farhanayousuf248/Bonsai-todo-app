## 🚀 Roadmap (Phase 4 & Beyond)

While Phase 3 provides a comprehensive CLI experience, the future of Todo App includes several exciting directions:

- **Persistent Database (SQL):** Transitioning from in-memory storage to SQLite or PostgreSQL for permanent data persistence.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Developing a desktop version using `Tkinter` or `PyQt` for a more visual user experience.
- **Cloud Syncing:** Implementing API integration to sync tasks across multiple devices and platforms.
- **AI-Powered Prioritization:** Integrating LLMs (like Claude) to automatically categorize tasks and suggest prioritization based on deadlines and descriptions.
- **Web Interface:** Converting the system into a full-stack web application using `Flask` or `FastAPI` with a modern React frontend.

## 🤝 Contributing

This project follows **Spec-Driven Development**:

1. All changes must have a specification first
2. No feature without acceptance criteria
3. Constitutional constraints are non-negotiable
4. Follow the workflow: Constitution → Specification → Planning → Execution → QA → Checklist

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

Developing this Todo App has been a transformative experience in software engineering. Over three phases, I have moved from basic scripting to building a complex, production-ready system. Key skills mastered include:

- **Spec-Driven Development (SDD):** Learned to prioritize planning over coding. By defining features, acceptance criteria, and technical constraints upfront, I eliminated "feature creep" and ensured 100% adherence to project goals.
- **Modular Python Architecture:** Implemented a strictly layered architecture (Separation of Concerns). The UI logic (CLI), Data Layer (Storage), and Domain Logic (Business Rules) are independent, making the system highly maintainable and easy to refactor.
- **Automated Testing & QA:** achieved **100% test coverage** across 27 core features. Developing a comprehensive suite of 172 tests taught me the value of regression testing and the discipline required to maintain a zero-defect codebase.
- **Complex Data Structures:** Mastered hierarchical data management (parent-child subtasks) and graph-based logic (task dependencies). Implementing Depth-First Search (DFS) for circular dependency detection was a highlight in algorithm design.
- **Advanced Logic Implementation:** Successfully architected complex features like an **Undo System** (state snapshotting), **Recurring Logic** (pattern automation), and **Template Systems** (configuration reuse).

This project represents my growth from a Python student to a disciplined software engineer, capable of delivering professional-grade, well-documented, and thoroughly tested applications.
